# AI and Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my repository dedicated to showcasing a selection of AI and Machine Learning scripts I've developed over time. While not all scripts are currently available for public viewâ€”due to their integral role in my startup, chuttr.com

## Featured Model: Named Entity Recognition (NER)

The NER model has been trained on a specific niche industy using a large data set of 1.6 million rows of unstructured data. The NER model effectively takes inputs and processes that unstructured data into filtered, structured data assigned to 12 entitys (categories) for future use. 

Stay tuned as I progressively unveil more tools and techniques that power the cutting-edge solutions at chuttr.
